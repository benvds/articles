# Persuasion for user happiness
# Introducing new features â€” sales techniques for existing customers
# Thoughts on ...

Each user perceives your product differently and they're all vastly different from your own perception. The exact same thing can be perceived as more valuable which makes for happier and more patient users, more sales and less support.

This doesn't just apply to new users and features but also to existing. Lots of lessons can be taking from the sales and persuasion field and applied to a User Experience Design (UXD).


_Niet alleen gebruiken voor sales/aantrekken nieuwe gebruikers maar geldt ook voor bestaande gebruikers._

## Reciprocation

Reciprocation is the social construct where a positive action is met with another positive action. In other words; people treat you better when you're nice to them. Give the user a little amount of value, either content or functionality. New products can provide blog content, tutorials, a trail period or some limited free usage.

When introducing new features and changes to existing users they can be reluctant. Existing users have to relearn some part of the system which takes time and energy. Prevent frustration by gradually introduce new features with clarity, emphasize benefits, don't get in their way. Let them explore and find out when they're ready, often they have deadlines to make first.

## Commitment and consistency



questionnaire, feature request, testing group, gathering feedback

these can include loaded questions for steering users to where you want to go, this allows for adding features which are normally harder to sell.

for example: "are stability and performance important  to you?" giving you the opportunity to do a refactoring release like Apple successfully did with their Snow Leopard release.


## social proof

test your releases with a small user group, communicate the results of your quesionair: "you've requested, well here it is!"

inform them they could help you (now it's their turn to help you) by providing feedback on the features, ask them if you could use the feedback to inspire other users reap the benefits of this great release

use this feedback as testimonials when introducing the new features to all other users


## liking


_Relatie maakt het makkelijker met happiness duidelijker naar voren laten komen. Gebruikers meer geduld_

get to know your customer, talk to them, be human

emphasize similarity

complement the user, "wow, you've been able to save a lot of administrative time by using feature x!"

personalize the relationship

## authority

probably is hard to get celebrities to endorse you

use a quotes and a metric instead

keep the message clear and don't overdo it

## scarcity

the power of potential loss is a remarkable influencer but don't take anything away from the product, users already paid for it.

you could use a limited user test group for this, make applying to this group visible, and let them only test for a short while

maybe you want to upsell a release, this way you can offer a temporary discount.

maybe sell a premium version, and use this group of early adopters as the test user-group as they have a big influence on the early majority

## reciprocation
Give the user something small to start the relationships and gradually getting them committed and engaged.

Communicate both story and evidence (meten = weten). Also, balance arguments are more persuasive. Get them to agree with you first. Find out preferences (user research) and show them the tailored results. (giving)

The better the relationship, the more people will like you. Building this relationship using ditigal goods can be done in various ways. This also means it isn't a one time action but takes time and preferable a conversion.
You should initiate this conversation by communication what the current state of the project, explaining the process and showing them a glimpse of the future. This gives them time to get used to any ideas/changes.

Getting users engaged is the other part of the conversation. This should also start early on in the process. Ask them for feedback and make it clear they have influence on the project. [cheese] Yes, your opinion matters to us. [/cheese].

Express gratitude to all people making this release posssible, make special note of notable contributers; both users and builders.

It can be hard to have a close relationship to every user. But the one's you have you can use to trigger the other one's. Using social proof of similar people, in other words other users. Gather and communicate positive feedback to these users when introducing new features. This can be done before in a newsletters and once live during a one-off introduction.

The newsletters or one-off feature introduction should include the feature introduction, the proven metrics and the positive user feedback.

During all of this "less is more" still applies. Don't over do it, you'll lose the sale, Clarity trumps persuasion.
