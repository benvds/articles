# Developers can learn interaction design

Developers are the ones who work hard on difficult problems with short deadlines. But once users get their hands on the product and things go wrong they still get the blame. The product has tons of features and almost no bugs, so what are they complaining about? Users are just dumb. 

The most common mistake I see developers make is that they're modeling the product towards their own mental model. Everything is displayed in excel like lists, and items can only be found navigating the same relations as found in the database.

Developers design interfaces this way because this is how they see the system. They have knowledge of how computers in general, the subject field and how the system itself works while the user does not. The user does not think about how or why the system works this way, they simply don't care, they just want to get things done.

Compare this to using public transport to get to a coffee shop. Having understanding of how trains, metros and trams work, and knowledge of the area it’s easy to reason how to get to the coffee shop. Imagine never having used public transport, never having been on a metro or tram, never having seen the maps and different direction signs and only knowing the address of the coffee shop. Things will be overwhelming, you’ll need to take small steps, it will take longer and some extra help along the way will certainly be nice.

It's often said that just applying the rules and best practices of interaction design isn't enough to get a good design and some additional esthetic "feeling" is required. This is nonsense, besides the common patterns the only thing extra needed for a good interaction design is empathy.

The esthetics are just the sugar no top, it's about what the product communicates, not how it works. Having empathy will show you things most important to your users, which isn't just features but well thought out use cases.

Just like managers should care about technical debt, making for a more lasting code base and happier developers, developers should care about users.

 to build a better overall product. Empathizing with users will make you drop a feature for a better workflow or get the product just a little bit faster.

- take responsibility for the whole products, just like managers should
- rule out designers
- happier users make for happier developers
- happiness

So empathize with your and help them out getting their way around, because often there’s another coffeeshop just around the corner.
